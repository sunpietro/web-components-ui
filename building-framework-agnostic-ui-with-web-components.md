# Building framework agnostic UI with Web Components

## Introduction

## Framework agnostic UI concept

The framework agnostic UI means the application/website interface built without using any non-native set of tools. We're using only native browser APIs in order to deliver as much functionalities as possible. Making it framework agnostic, where by framework agnostic I mean: "Not using any JavaScript frameworks" allows us to re-use existing UI components in many different projects. Other frameworks will not break any functionality of UI component.
